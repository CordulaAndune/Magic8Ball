# Magic8Ball

The app is based on the magic 8 balls, which give random answers to yes/no-question by shaking them.

After thinking about a question, the device can be shaken and one of eleven answers is pseudorandomly chosen and displayed with text and an emoji.

A shake is defined by an g-force greater than 2.7 ( when g-force due to the gravity of the earth = 1).
If the device does not have a accelerometer, the shake detecotr is replaced by an onClickListener and the answer is given after clicking the image.

Answers are avaible in English and German
